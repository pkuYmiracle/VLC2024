# 硬件实现

## 中文

在项目中，我们对两块 STM32 单片机做了编程。一块集成了光电传感器的 STM32G030F6Px 开发板作为接受端，另一块 STM32G473CBTx开发板与液晶相连，作为发送端。host 通过串口将 message 传输给发送端的MCU，MCU 解析发送的数据，将其二进制表示转换为相应电压，并加给与液晶相连的引脚。
我们所使用的液晶为偏振液晶。液晶中的化合物分子在没有电场作用时呈现无序排列，无法对光产生偏振效果，但是，当电场作用于液晶分子时，液晶分子会发生取向，呈现有序排列的状态。因此，液晶可以根据电场作用改变光的偏振状态。实验中，我们将偏振片，液晶和光源依次排列。当我们不给液晶加电压时，因为没有电场作用，液晶分子会将光的偏振方向旋转90度，使其与偏振片的方向匹配，透过偏振片的光就会呈现较亮的状态。给液晶加电压时，液晶分子会发生取向，使其不再旋转光的偏振方向，这意味着通过液晶的光将被偏振片滤去很多成分，显示出黯淡的状态。因此，我们可以通过我们加在液晶上电压的强度调节光的透过率，实现明暗的变化。
接收端的光电传感器通过光电效应，将可见光的光信号转换为电信号。MCU 定时读取光电传感器的值，并通过串口将其传给接收端的 host。host 通过时钟恢复等手段，将明暗波形还原为传输message的二进制串。如此实现一次传输。

接下来介绍具体的硬件实现：

### Sender

Sender 端 MCU 总体而言如此设计。当 host 通过串口向 MCU 传递数据时，使用 UART DMA 传输，因为 bypass了kernel，这比普通的UART传输更快。每当 MCU 接受到串口的数据时， MCU 解析数据，并通过 DAC 给液晶加不同的电压。在传输的过程中，采用 HAL_Delay 做时钟控制。

由于硬件的限制，我们无法实现完全精准的时钟对齐。为了应对传输过程中的时钟错位，我们必须在编码中引入时钟恢复机制。
由于偏振液晶的特性，我们可以通过分隔符传递时钟。因为通过调整光的透过率，液晶可以实现连续的光强变化，而非仅仅是明暗两种状态。虽然引入太多状态会导致难以分辨，但是仅仅引入一个状态作为分隔符是可行的。
当然，也可以采用传统的物理层编码方式，譬如曼彻斯特码，米勒码，4B5B等等。

Sender 端 MCU 的数据解析也因物理层编码方式而异。
若采用分隔符来编码，则将添加分隔符和开始符的逻辑耦合在MCU的代码中，这样更加便捷而高效。在每一次传输开始时，MCU将连续将液晶设置成高电压，以提醒接收端传输开始，然后，输出固定长度的低电压，以方便接收端定位有效数据的开始。对传输的 16 进制串，MCU会遍历每一bit。若为0，则将 DAC 值设置为0，若为 1，则将 DAC 值设置为 4095，并在每一位间插入间隔符，经过实验，将 DAC 值设置为 2500 的效果时较好的。值得注意的是，由于液晶的性能限制，当液晶闪烁地过快时，会出现前一个状态的转换尚未完成，但下一个状态已经到达的情况。这会导致分割符变得相当难以分辨。因此，采用分隔符编码有相当严重的性能瓶颈。
若采用传统的编码方式，则完全将Encode的任务交给host，MCU 只负责将传输的16进制串解析为二进制串，根据每一位值给与液晶相连的 DAC 引脚加相应电压。

### Receiver

Receiver 端的逻辑较为简单，即定时通过 ADC 读取光电传感器的值，并将其通过串口传输给接收端的 host。其中，定时机制通过 STM32 的 Timer 实现，每过一段时间就调用一次Timer的 callback，并在 callback 中实现主要逻辑。同时，为了提高性能，串口传输使用 DMA。
但在实验过程中，也出现了不少问题。当 Timer 的频率过高时，一则会导致 host 端的串口读取数据无法做到对齐，从而使得数据失真，二则会使串口的缓冲区溢出，使得数据丢失。同时，每调用一次串口传输函数都会导致额外的开销。为了应对这种问题，我们在 MCU 和 host 两端都添加了buffer机制。在 MCU 端维护一段buffer，当buffer未满时，只是将从光电传感器poll到的值放入buffer中，若buffer满了，则一次性通过DMA传输将其传给host。Host端也不是每有数据就读取之，而是当累计in waiting 的数据大于 400 bit时，一次性读取400bit，并处理之。实验证明，这种方法起到了不错的效果。
尽管如此，Receiver端还是有一些性能瓶颈存在，猜测是光电传感器的 ADC 采样频率本身有限制。目前而言，只能在 1khz 左右做到较好的效果。

In the project, we programmed two STM32 microcontrollers. One board, integrating a photodetector sensor, serves as the receiving end using the STM32G030F6Px development board. The other board, STM32G473CBTx, is connected to a liquid crystal display (LCD) and serves as the transmitting end. The host transmits a message to the MCU on the transmitting end via a serial port. The MCU parses the received data, converts its binary representation to corresponding voltages, and applies them to the pins connected to the LCD.

The LCD used in our setup is a polarized liquid crystal display. In the absence of an electric field, the compound molecules in the liquid crystal exhibit a disordered arrangement, preventing the polarization effect on light. However, when an electric field is applied to the liquid crystal molecules, they orient themselves into an ordered state. Therefore, the LCD can change the polarization state of light based on the electric field. In our experiment, we arrange a polarizer, liquid crystal, and light source sequentially. When we do not apply voltage to the liquid crystal, the molecules rotate the polarization direction of light by 90 degrees, matching it with the polarizer's direction, resulting in a brighter appearance. Applying voltage to the liquid crystal causes the molecules to align, preventing the rotation of the polarization direction. This means that light passing through the liquid crystal will be filtered out by the polarizer, resulting in a dim state. Thus, we can adjust the transparency of light by modulating the voltage applied to the liquid crystal, achieving changes in brightness.

The photodetector sensor on the receiving end converts visible light signals into electrical signals through the photoelectric effect. The MCU reads the sensor values at regular intervals and transmits them to the host on the receiving end via a serial port. The host, through clock recovery and other means, restores the brightness waveform to the binary string representing the transmitted message, completing one transmission.

### Sender MCU

The design of the MCU on the sender side is as follows. When the host transmits data to the MCU via UART, UART DMA transfer is used to bypass the kernel, making it faster than regular UART transmission. Whenever the MCU receives data from the serial port, it parses the data and applies different voltages to the LCD through the DAC. HAL_Delay is used for clock control during the transmission process.

Due to hardware limitations, achieving precise clock alignment is challenging. To address clock misalignment during transmission, a clock recovery mechanism must be introduced in the encoding. Due to the characteristics of polarized liquid crystal, clock information can be transmitted through separators. Adjusting the transparency of light, the liquid crystal can achieve continuous changes in light intensity, not just two distinct states of brightness and darkness. Although introducing too many states may lead to difficulty in discrimination, introducing a single state as a separator is feasible. Of course, traditional physical layer encoding methods such as Manchester code, Miller code, 4B5B, etc., can also be employed.

The data parsing on the MCU on the sender side varies depending on the physical layer encoding method. If a separator is used for encoding, the logic for adding separators and start symbols will be coupled in the MCU's code, making it more convenient and efficient. At the beginning of each transmission, the MCU sets the LCD to a high voltage continuously to signal the start of the transmission to the receiving end. Then, it outputs a fixed length of low voltage to help the receiving end locate the start of valid data. For the transmitted hexadecimal string, the MCU iterates through each bit. If it is 0, the DAC value is set to 0; if it is 1, the DAC value is set to 4095. An interval symbol is inserted between each bit. Through experimentation, setting the DAC value to 2500 provides optimal results. It is important to note that due to the performance limitations of the LCD, rapid blinking can result in situations where the transition of the previous state is not complete while the next state has already arrived, making separators challenging to discern. Therefore, using separator encoding has significant performance bottlenecks.

If traditional encoding methods are used, the encoding task is entirely delegated to the host. The MCU is only responsible for parsing the transmitted hexadecimal string into a binary string and applying the corresponding voltage to the DAC pin connected to the LCD based on each bit's value.

### Receiver MCU

The logic on the receiver side is relatively simple. It periodically reads the value from the photodetector sensor through ADC, then transmits it to the host on the receiving end via UART. The timing mechanism is implemented using the STM32 Timer, where the Timer's callback is invoked at regular intervals to execute the main logic. Additionally, to improve performance, UART transmission utilizes DMA.

However, several issues were encountered during the experimental process. When the Timer's frequency is too high, it can cause misalignment in the host's UART data reading, resulting in data distortion. Moreover, it may lead to buffer overflow in the UART's buffer, resulting in data loss. Also, each call to the UART transmission function incurs additional overhead. To address these issues, buffer mechanisms were added on both ends, MCU and host.

On the MCU side, a buffer is maintained. When the buffer is not full, the values polled from the photodetector sensor are placed into the buffer. When the buffer is full, the entire buffer is transmitted to the host in a single DMA transfer. On the host side, data is not read every time it arrives. Instead, data is read and processed in chunks when the accumulated waiting data reaches a threshold, such as 400 bits. Experimental results show that this approach has proven effective.

Despite these improvements, there are still some performance bottlenecks on the receiver side, and it is speculated that the limited ADC sampling frequency of the photodetector sensor is a contributing factor. Currently, achieving satisfactory results is possible at around 1 kHz.
